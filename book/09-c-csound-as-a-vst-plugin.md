09 C. CSOUND AS A VST PLUGIN
============================

Csound can be built into a VST or AU plugin through the use of the
Csound host API. Refer to the section on using the Csound API for more
details. 

If you are not well versed in low level computer programming you can
just use [Cabbage](https://www.cabbageaudio.com) to create Csound based plugins.  See the [Cabbage chapter](10-b-cabbage.md) in part 10 of this manual.
