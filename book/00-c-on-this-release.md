ON THIS RELEASE
===============

A year on from the 5th release, this release adds some exciting new
sections as well as a number of chapter augmentations and necessary
updates. Notable are Michael Gogins' Chapter on running Csound within a
browser using HTML5 technology, Victor Lazarrini's and Ed Costello's
explanations about Web based Csound, and a new chapter describing the
pairing of Csound with the Haskell programming language.

Thanks to all contributors to this release.
