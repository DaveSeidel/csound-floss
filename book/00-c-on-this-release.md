ON THIS RELEASE
===============

some catchwords here for later elaboration:

- new platform
- playable examples
- cleanup and re-written lots of things
- substituted figures
- added a lot of cross references
- rewritten chapters:
  - 04 C AM
  - 04 D FM
  - 05 I FFT

try to find a balance between no presuppositions for reading (so as basic as possible) and interesting also for advanced users (so as elaborated as possible)
