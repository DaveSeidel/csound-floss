11 B. FILE INFO AND CONVERSION
==============================

sndinfo
-------

The utility *sndinfo* (sound information) provides the user with some information about one or more sound files. *sndinfo* is invoked and provided with a file name:

    sndinfo ../SourceMaterials/fox.wav

If you are unsure of the file address of your sound file you can always
just drag and drop it into the terminal window. The output should be
something like:

    util sndinfo:
    ../SourceMaterials/fox.wav:
	    srate 44100, monaural, 16 bit WAV, 2.757 seconds
	    (121569 sample frames)

*sndinfo* will accept a list of file names and provide information on
all of them in one go so it may prove more efficient gleaning the same
information from a GUI based sample editor. We also have the advantage
of being able to copy and paste from the terminal window into a .csd
file.


File Conversion Utilities
-------------------------

### het_import / het_export

The utilities 
[het\_import](https://csound.com/docs/manual/het_import.html) and 
[het\_export](https://csound.com/docs/manual/het_export.html)
are marked as deprecated because the files generated by 
[hetro](https://csound.com/docs/manual/hetro.html) are text files nowadays.


### pvlook

The [pvlook](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvlook.html) utility shows the output of a STFT analysis files created with [pvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvanal.html). The invocation is:

    pvlook [flags] infilename

As these files contain a big amount of information, the *flags* contain some options to select a range of bins and frames:  
- *-bb* and *-eb* set the begin and end of the bin number for the output (defaulting to lowest and highest bin)  
- *-bf* and *-ef* set the begin and end of the analysis frames to be printed (defaulting to first and last frame).

If we want to look at the fifth bin only in the frames 100-110 or the file *fox.pvx", we run:

    pvlook -bb 5 -eb 5 -bf 100 -ef 110 fox.pvx

The output is:

~~~
util pvlook:

### pvexport / pvimport

Another method of transforming a .pvx analysis file created by  
[pvanal](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pvanal.html) is done with the
[pv\_export](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pv_export.html) utility. It converts the binary file to a text file. After some general information about the source file in the header, each line contains amp-freq pairs of the bins. 

The text file can be re-converted to a binary .pvx file with the
[pv\_import](https://csound.com/docs/manual/pv_import.html) utility.


### sdif2ad

The [hetro](https://csound.com/docs/manual/hetro.html) utility will create an [sdif](http://cnmat.org/SDIF/) file if the extension *.sdif* is given for the outfile. This file can be converted by the
[sdif2ad](https://csound.com/docs/manual/sdif2ad.html) utility to a file which can be used by the [adsyn](https://csound.com/docs/manual/adsyn.html) opcode.
