C. INTENSITIES

Real World Intensities and Amplitudes
-------------------------------------

There are many ways to describe a sound physically. One of the most
common is the sound intensity level (SIL). It describes the amount of
power on a certain surface, so its unit is Watts per square meter
([]{title="<img title="}

at the threshold of pain. For ordering this immense range, and to
facilitate the measurement of one sound intensity based upon its ratio
with another, a logarithmic scale is used. The unit *Bel* describes the
relation of one intensity [I]{title="<math title="} to a reference
intensity [I~0~]{title="<math title="} as follows:

[]{title="<img title="}

If, for example, the ratio  []{title="<img title="}

For real world sounds, it makes sense to set the reference value

to the threshold of hearing which has been fixed as

at 1000 Hertz. So the range of human hearing covers about 12 Bel.
Usually 1 Bel is divided into 10 decibel, so the common formula for
measuring a sound intensity is:

While the sound intensity level is useful in describing the way in which
human hearing works, the measurement of sound is more closely related to
the sound pressure deviations. Sound waves compress and expand the air
particles and by this they increase and decrease the localized air
pressure. These deviations are measured and transformed by a microphone.
The question arises: what is the relationship between the sound pressure
deviations and the sound intensity? The answer is: sound intensity
changes []{title="<img title="}

  *Relation between Sound Intensity and Sound Pressure*

Let us take an example to see what this means. The sound pressure at the
threshold of hearing can be fixed at []{title="<img title="}

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![](static/www.imathas.com/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi?%5Cdisplaystyle%5Cblack%7B2%7D%5Ccdot%7B%7B10%7D%7D%5E%7B%7B-%7B%7B5%7D%7D%7D%7D%7BP%7D%7Ba%7D "2*10^-5 Pa")
:::
:::

. This value is the reference value of the Sound Pressure Level (SPL).
If we now have a value of []{title="<img title="}

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![](static/www.imathas.com/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi?%5Cdisplaystyle%5Cblack%7B2%7D%5Ccdot%7B%7B10%7D%7D%5E%7B%7B-%7B%7B4%7D%7D%7D%7D%7BP%7D%7Ba%7D "2*10^-4 Pa")
:::
:::

, the corresponding sound intensity relationship can be calculated as:

[]{title="<img title="}

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![](static/www.imathas.com/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi?%5Cdisplaystyle%5Cblack%7B%7B%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%7B%7B2%7D%5Ccdot%7B%7B10%7D%7D%5E%7B%7B4%7D%7D%7D%7D%7B%7B%7B2%7D%5Ccdot%7B%7B10%7D%7D%5E%7B%7B5%7D%7D%7D%7D%5Cright)%7D%7D%5E%7B%7B2%7D%7D=%7B%7B10%7D%7D%5E%7B%7B2%7D%7D=%7B100%7D "((2*10^4)/(2*10^5))^2 = 10^2 = 100")

Therefore a factor of 10 in a pressure relationship yields a factor of
100 in the intensity relationship. In general, the dB scale for the
pressure [P]{title="<math title="} related to the pressure
[P0]{title="<math title="} is:

Working with digital audio means working with *amplitudes*. Any audio
file is a sequence of amplitudes. What you generate in Csound and write
either to the DAC in realtime or to a sound file, are again nothing but
a sequence of amplitudes. As amplitudes are directly related to the
sound pressure deviations, all the relationships between sound intensity
and sound pressure can be transferred to relationships between sound
intensity and amplitudes:

If you drive an oscillator with an amplitude of 1, and another
oscillator with an amplitude of 0.5 and you want to know the difference
in dB, you can calculate this as follows:

[]{title="<img title="}

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![](static/www.imathas.com/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi?%5Cdisplaystyle%5Cblack%7B20%7D%5Ccdot%7B%5Clog%7D_%7B%7B10%7D%7D%5Cfrac%7B%7B1%7D%7D%7B%7B0.5%7D%7D=%7B20%7D%5Ccdot%7B%5Clog%7D_%7B%7B10%7D%7D%7B2%7D=%7B20%7D%5Ccdot%7B0.30103%7D=%7B6.0206%7D%7Bd%7D%7BB%7D "20*log_10 1/0.5 = 20 * log_10 2 = 20 * 0.30103 = 6.0206 dB")
:::
:::

 

The most useful thing to bear in mind is that when you double an
amplitude this will provide a change of +6 dB, or when you have halve an
amplitude this will provide a change in of -6 dB.

 

What is 0 dB?
-------------

As described in the last section, any dB scale - for intensities,
pressures or amplitudes - is just a way to describe a *relationship*. To
have any sort of quantitative measurement you will need to know the
reference value referred to as \"0 dB\". For real world sounds, it makes
sense to set this level to the threshold of hearing. This is done, as we
saw, by setting the SIL to []{title="<img title="}

.

When working with digital sound within a computer, this method for
defining 0dB will not make any sense. The loudness of the sound produced
in the computer will ultimately depend on the amplification and the
speakers, and the amplitude level set in your audio editor or in Csound
will only apply an additional, and not an absolute, sound level control.
Nevertheless, there *is* a rational reference level for the amplitudes.
In a digital system, there is a strict limit for the maximum number you
can store as amplitude. This maximum possible level is normally used as
the reference point for 0 dB.

Each program connects this maximum possible amplitude with a number.
Usually it is \'1\' which is a good choice, because you know that
everything above 1 is clipping, and you have a handy relation for lower
values. But actually this value is nothing but a setting, and in Csound
you are free to set it to any value you like via the
[0dbfs](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/Zerodbfs.html) opcode.
Usually you should use this statement in the orchestra header:

    0dbfs = 1

This means: \"Set the level for zero dB as full scale to 1 as reference
value.\" Note that for historical reasons the default value in Csound is
not 1 but 32768. So you must have this *0dbfs=1* statement in your
header if you want to use the amplitude convention used by most modern
audio programming environments.

 

dB Scale Versus Linear Amplitude
--------------------------------

Now we will consider some practical consequences of what we have
discussed so far. One major point is that for achieving perceivably
smooth changes across intensity levels you must not use a simple linear
transition of the amplitudes, but a linear transition of the dB
equivalent. The following example shows a linear rise of the amplitudes
from 0 to 1, and then a linear rise of the dB\'s from -80 to 0 dB, both
over 10 seconds.

The first note, which employs a linear rise in amplitude, is perceived
as rising quickly in intensity with the rate of increase slowing
quickly. The second note, which employs a linear rise in decibels, is
perceived as a more constant rise in intensity.

 

RMS Measurement
---------------

Sound intensity depends on many factors. One of the most important is
the effective mean of the amplitudes in a certain time span. This is
called the Root Mean Square (RMS) value. To calculate it, you have (1)
to calculate the squared amplitudes of number N samples. Then you (2)
divide the result by N to calculate the mean of it. Finally (3) take the
square root.

Let us consider a simple example and then look how to derive rms values
within Csound. Assuming we have a sine wave which consists of 16
samples, we get these amplitudes:

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![16 times sampled sine wave](static/sine_16points_v2.png){width="619"
height="391"} 
:::
:::

These are the squared amplitudes:

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![](static/sine_16points_rms_v2.png){width="603" height="373"}
:::
:::

The mean of these values is:

[(0+0.146+0.5+0.854+1+0.854+0.5+0.146+0+0.146+0.5+0.854+1+0.854+0.5+0.146)/16=8/16=0.5]{title="<math title="}

And the resulting RMS value is sqrt([0.5) = 0.707]{title="<math title="}
. 

The [rms](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/rms.html) opcode in Csound
calculates the RMS power in a certain time span, and smoothes the values
in time according to the *ihp* parameter: the higher this value is (the
default is 10 Hz), the quicker this measurement will respond to changes,
and vice versa. This opcode can be used to implement a self-regulating
system, in which the rms opcode prevents the system from exploding. Each
time the rms value exceeds a certain value, the amount of feedback is
reduced. This is an example^1^ :

Fletcher-Munson Curves
----------------------

The range of human hearing is roughly from 20 to 20000 Hz, but within
this range, the hearing is not equally sensitive to intensity. The most
sensitive region is around 3000 Hz. If a sound is operating in the upper
or lower limits of this range, it will need greater intensity in order
to be perceived as equally loud. 

These curves of equal loudness are mostly called \"Fletcher-Munson
Curves\" because of the paper of H. Fletcher and W. A. Munson in 1933.
They look like this:

::: {.group_img}
::: {.image}
![](static/fletcher-munson.png){width="422" height="375"} 
:::
:::

Try the following test. During the first 5 seconds you will hear a tone
of 3000 Hz. Adjust the level of your amplifier to the lowest possible
level at which you still can hear the tone. Next you hear a tone whose
frequency starts at 20 Hertz and ends at 20000 Hertz, over 20 seconds.
Try to move the fader or knob of your amplification exactly in a way
that you still can hear anything, but as soft as possible. The movement
of your fader should roughly be similar to the lowest
Fletcher-Munson-Curve: starting relatively high, going down and down
until 3000 Hertz, and then up again. Of course, this effectiveness of
this test will also depend upon the quality of your speaker hardware. If
your speakers do not provide adequate low frequency response, you will
not hear anything in the bass region.

It is very important to bear in mind when designing instruments that the
perceived loudness of a sound will depend upon its frequency content.
You must remain aware that projecting a 30 Hz sine at a certain
amplitude will be perceived differently to a 3000 Hz sine at the same
amplitude; the latter will sound much louder.
