11 C. MISCELLANEOUS
===================

A final group gathers together various unsorted utilities:
[cs](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cs.html),
[csb64enc](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/csb64enc.html),
[envext](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/envext.html),
[extractor](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/extractor.html),
[makecsd](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/makecsd.html),
[mixer](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/mixer.html),
[scale](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/scaleutility.html) and
[mkdb](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/mkdb.html). Most interesting
of these are perhaps
[extractor](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/extractor.html) which
will extract a user defined fragment of a sound file which it will then
write to a new file,
[mixer](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/mixer.html) which mixes
together any number of sound files and with gain control over each file
and [scale](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/scaleutility.html) which
will scale the amplitude of an individual sound file.

Conclusion
----------

It has been seen that the Csound utilities offer a wealth of useful, but
often overlooked, tools to augment our work with Csound. Whilst some of
these utilities may seem redundant now that most of us have access to
fully featured 3rd-party sound editing software, it should be borne in
mind that many of these utilities were written in the 1980s and early
90s when such tools were less readily available.
