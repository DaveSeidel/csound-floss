  <body><h1>CSOUNDQT</h1><h2>CsoundQt</h2>
<p>CsoundQt is a free, cross-platform graphical frontend to Csound.
It features syntax highlighting, code completion and a graphical
widget editor for realtime control of Csound. It comes with many
useful code examples, from basic tutorials to complex synthesizers
and pieces written in Csound. It also features an integrated Csound
language help display.</p>
<p>CsoundQt (named QuteCsound until automn 2011) can be used as a
code editor tailored for Csound, as it facilitates running and
rendering Csound files without the need of typing on the command
line using the Run and Render buttons.</p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/snapshot1.png" alt="" width="600" height="371"/></div></div>
<p>In the widget editor panel, you can create a variety of widgets
to control Csound. To link the value from a widget, you first need
to set its channel, and then use the Csound opcodes invalue or
chnget. To send values to widgets, e.g. for data display, you need
to use the outvalue or chnset opcode.</p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/snapshot2.png" alt="" width="600" height="466"/></div></div><br/>
CsoundQt also now implements the use of HTML and JavaScript code
embedded in the optional &lt;html&gt; element of the CSD file. If
this element is detected, CsoundQt will parse it out as a Web page,
compile it, and display it in the 'HTML5 Gui' window. HTML code in
this window can control Csound via a selected part of the Csound
API that is exposed in JavaScript. This can be used to define
custom user interfaces, display video and 3D graphics, generate
Csound scores, and much more. See Chapter 12, Section H, <em>Csound
and Html</em> for more information.
<p>CsoundQt also offers convenient facilities for score editing in
a spreadsheet like environment which can be transformed using
Python scripting (see also chapter 12C).</p>

<h3>Configuring CsoundQt </h3>
<p>CsoundQt gives easy access to the most important <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/CommandFlags.html">Csound
options</a> and to many specific CsoundQt settings via its
Configuration Panel. In particular the 'Run' tab offers many
choices which have to be understood and set carefully.</p>
<p>The current version of CsoundQt's configuration settings should
be found at <a href="http://qutecsound.sourceforge.net/pages/documentation.html.">http://qutecsound.sourceforge.net/pages/documentation.html.</a>
So the following descriptions may be outdated.</p>
<p>To open the configuration panel simply push the 'Configure'
button. The configuration panel comprises 7 tabs. The available
configurable parameters in each tab are described below for each
tab.</p>
<h4>Run</h4>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_01_run.png" alt="" width="500" height="517"/></div></div>
<p>The settings at the top of the “Run” tab allow the user to
define the command-line flags with which Csound is invoked.</p>
<p><strong><span>Buffer Size (-b)</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>This defines the software buffer size (corresponding
with the -b flag).<br/>
If you do not tick, CsoundQt will use the defaults.<sup data-id="ecda606c-5669-4e9b-90e4-a345530f6c05" class="endnote">1</sup> <br/>

If you tick to enter an own value, these are some hints:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Always use power-of-two values.</li>
<li>Usually the <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/ksmps.html">ksmps</a> block
size is 1/4 or 1/2 of the software buffer size. If you use live
input and output, it is most effective to set the software buffer
size to an integer multiple of <em>ksmps</em> ("full duplex
audio").</li>
<li>Use smaller values (e.g. 128) for live performance (in
particular with live input), as it will reduce the latency. Use
larger values (e.g. 1024) for other cases, for instance playing
sound files.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span><strong>HW Buffer Size (-B)</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>This defines the hardware buffer size (corresponding
with the -B flag).<br/>
If you do not tick, CsoundQt will use the defaults.<sup data-id="e91c947c-aa88-4fdf-b1fe-40633ec3201e" class="endnote">2</sup> <br/>

If you tick to enter an own value, these are some hints:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Always use a multiple integer of the software buffer size. A
common relation is: Hardware Buffer Size = 4 * Software Buffer
Size.</li>
<li>The relation between software buffer size and hardware buffer
size depends on the audio module.<sup data-id="018b55c0-8b98-4c44-8546-3dd4390aed1e" class="endnote">3</sup></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Use new parser</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Tick this if you use Csound 5.14 or higher. This option
has been introduced during the transition between the old and the
new parser, and will disappear in future.</blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Use multicore /Number of
threads</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>This option is only available when the new parser is
enabled, and corresponds with the -j flag. <span>For instance, ‘-j
2‘ will tell Csound to use 2 parallel processors when
possible.</span><br/>
You should use this option with care. It may be also worth to state
that using multiple threads will not in each case improve the
performance. Whether it does or not depends on the structure of the
csd file you run.</blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Dither</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Switches on dithering (the --dither flag) for the
conversion of audio from the internal resolution (now mostly 64 bit
double precision float) to the output sample format (see
below).</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Additional command line flags</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This enables the user to add any additional
<a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/CommandFlags.html">options</a>
not listed here. Only use if you know what you are
doing!</span></blockquote>
<h5><span>File (offline render)</span></h5>
<p><span>These options determine CsoundQt's behaviour if you render
to file (by pushing the <em>Render</em> button or selecting the
menu item Control -&gt; Render to file).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Use CsoundQt options</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Tick this to activate the CsoundQT options
configured here.</span></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Ignore CsOptions</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Use this to ignore the option embedded in the
&lt;CsOptions&gt; section of the csd files you are
rendering.</span> <span><br/></span><span>NOTE that care must be
taken to avoid inconsistencies between CsOptions and CsoundQt
options. For beginners, it is recommended to tick "Ignore
CsOptions" when the CsoundQT options are enabled. If you are a more
experienced user, you can leave this unchecked to allow some
additional options like -m128 to reduce Csound's printout.</span>
<span><br/></span><span>NOTE that if you have checked "Use
CsoundQt options" and have <em>not</em> checked "Ignore CsOptions",
in the case of a conflict between both the CsoundQt options set in
the configure panel will have the
priority.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p> <span><strong>Ask for filename every
time</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>A</span>sk for a filename to render the
performance to.</blockquote>
<p> <span><strong>File type / Sample
format</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Use this to set the output file
format</span>.</blockquote>
<p> <span><strong>Input Filename</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Corresponds with the -i flag (Input soundfile
name).</span></blockquote>
<p> <span><strong>Output Filename</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Corresponds with</span> <span>the -o flag for
defining the output file name to which the sound is
written. </span></blockquote>
<h5><span>Realtime Play</span></h5>
<p><span>These options determine CsoundQt's behaviour if you push
the <em>Run</em> button (or select the menu item Control -&gt; Run
Csound).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Use CsoundQt options</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Tick this to activate the CsoundQT options
configured here.</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Ignore CsOptions</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Use this to ignore the option embedded in the
&lt;CsOptions&gt; section of the csd files you are running.</span>
<span><br/></span><span>NOTE that care must be taken to avoid
inconsistencies between CsOptions and CsoundQt options. For
beginners, it is recommended to disable CsOptions when the CsoundQT
options are enabled. If you are a more experienced user, you can
leave this unchecked to allow some additional options like -m128 to
reduce Csound's printout.</span> <span><br/></span><span>NOTE that
if you have checked "Use CsoundQt options" and have <em>not</em>
checked "Ignore CsOptions", in the case of a conflict between both
the CsoundQt options set in the configure panel will have the
priority.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>RT Audio Module</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option is very much dependent</span>
<span>on your operating system.<br/></span> <span>In case you
experience crashes or have problems with the real time performance,
it is worth to try another module.</span> <span><br/>
</span><span>The most common choices on the different operating
systems are probably:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li><span>For Linux, use alsa or jack.</span></li>
<li><span>For OSX, use coreaudio or portaudio.</span></li>
<li><span>For Windows, use portaudio.</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Input device</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option selects the device you are using for
real-time input, for instance from a microphone.</span> <span>(Note
that you must have ticked "Use CsoundQt options" if you want Csound
to use your selection.)<br/>
The usual (and most stable) choice here is <em>adc</em>. In this
case Csound will use the device which has been selected as standard
by your operating system.</span> <span><br/></span><span>If you
want to use another device instead, click on the button at the
right side. You will find a list of available devices and can
choose one of them.</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Output device</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option selects the device you are using for
real-time output.</span> <span>(Note that you must have ticked "Use
CsoundQt options" if you want Csound to use your selection.)</span>
<span><br/>

by your operating system.</span> <span><br/></span><span>If you
want to use another device instead, click on the button at the
right side. You will find a list of available devices and can
choose one of them.</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>RT MIDI Module</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option is very much dependent</span>
<span>on your operating system.<br/></span> <span>In case you
experience problems with MIDI, it is worth to try another
module.</span> <span>In case you do not use any MIDI at all, select
<em>none</em> to get rid of one possible source of
trouble.<br/></span> <span>The most common choices on the
different operating systems are probably:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li><span>For Linux, use alsa or portmidi.</span></li>
<li><span>For OSX, use coremidi<sup data-id="4d38f845-03ac-433a-9ad9-ce1bbfd7793d" class="endnote">4</sup> or
portmidi.</span></li>
<li><span>For Windows, use portmidi.</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Input device</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option selects the device you are using for
real-time MIDI input.</span> <span>(Note that you must have ticked
"Use CsoundQt options" if you want Csound to use your
selection.)<br/>
The usual choice here is <em>a</em>. In this case Csound will use
all MIDI devices.</span> <span><br/></span><span>In case your RT
MIDI Module does not support this option, click on the button at
the right side. You will find a list of available devices and can
choose one of them.</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Output device</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option selects the device you are using for
real-time MIDI output.</span> <span>(Note that you must have ticked
"Use CsoundQt options" if you want Csound to use your
selection.)</span> <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Jack client
nam</strong></span><span><strong>e</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>This option specifies the name for communicating
with a Jack audio client. The default '*' means 'all'
clients.</span> <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<h4><strong>General</strong></h4>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_02_general.png" alt="" width="500" height="519"/></div></div>
<h5><span>Run Utilities using:</span></h5>
<p><span>This should be self-explanatory and is only meaningful if
you run any of the Csound Utilities like <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/UtilityQueries.html">sndinfo</a>
or the FFT analysis tool <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/pvanal.html">pvanal</a>.</span></p>
<h5><span>Interface language</span></h5>
<p><span>Self-explanatory.</span></p>
<h5><span>Performance tweaks</span></h5>
<p>These are very important options in case you use CsoundQt for
real-time usage and experience performance problems.</p>
<p><span><strong>No messages to consoles</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>Tick this to disable any
printout.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Disable recording and scopes</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>This refers to CsoundQt's internal Record facility and
to the Scope widget. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Disable realtime score events</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><span>If you check this, you will not be able to send
any live score event, for instance from a Button widget or the Live
Event Sheet.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Disable python callback</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If you do not use CsoundQt's internal Python scripting
facility in real-time, you should check this to improve the overall
performance. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<h5><span>Internal MIDI interface</span></h5>
<p>The "Internal MIDI interface" is the MIDI device from which MIDI
control messages are sent directly to the CsoundQt widgets. Have a
look, for instance, in the properties of a Slider widget to see the
MIDI CC number and the MIDI Channel to be
specified.       <br/>
Note that this does <em>not</em> set the input MIDI device for
Csound itself (which has be explained above in Run -&gt; RT MIDI
Module -&gt; Input device).</p>
<h5><span>Record sample format</span></h5>
<p>Defines the bit depth of the audio file to which CsoundQt
records its real-time output, when using the Record button (or the
'record' option from the Control menu). For most cases 32bit float
or 24bit formats are recommended. The former is particularly useful
as it can hold ‘clipped‘ sample values, which can be later
normalised.</p>
<h5><span>Console</span></h5>
<p>You can choose here how the Csound output console looks
like.</p>
<p><span><strong>Control message buffer size</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If you do not not want to prevent CsoundQt from
printing anything to the console at all (see above) but want to
reduce this output for performance's sake, you can set here a
limit. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some mixed options at the bottom of this tab:</p>
<p><span><strong>Allow key repeats for sensekey</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If you press a key on your computer for a long time,
the key is repeated. This may or may not be useful for the <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/sensekey.html">sensekey</a>
opcode and can be decided here. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Debug mode for Live Event
Sheet</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Self-explanatory. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Allow simultaneous play</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If checked, it allows you to play more than one csd tab
simultansously. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Theme</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Allows you to choose between the traditional ("fun")
CsoundQt look, and a more serious ("boring") one. <span><br/>
</span></blockquote>
<p><strong>Widgets</strong></p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_03_widgets.png" alt="" width="500" height="520"/></div></div>
<p><span><strong>Enable Widgets</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If not checked, you cannot use any of CsoundQt's
widgets. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Save Widgets in csd file</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Each csd file has a section for widgets and presets.
These sections are hidden when you open your csd file in CsoundQt,
but are visible in any text editor. So if you do not have checked
this option, you will not see any of your widgets the next time you
open your csd. So, only useful if you want to export a csd without
the widget tags. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Show Widgets on play</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If checked, the widget panel will pop up each time you
push the Play button. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Show tooltips for widgets</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Enables a useful feature which lets you see the channel
name of a widget if you stay a moment on it with the computer
mouse. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Enable FLTK</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/ControlFltkIntro.html">F</a><span><a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/ControlFltkIntro.html">LTK</a>
means a built-in (and somehow outdated) method of using widgets in
Csound. As these widgets could conflict with CsoundQt's own
widgets, you will usually uncheck this.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Run FLTK csds in Terminal</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>This lets you execute <span>csd files which contain
FLTK widgets without conflicting with
CsoundQt.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Store Old Widget Format</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>CsoundQt started in using the file format for widgets
from Matt Ingall's 'Mac Csound' for the sake of compatibility.
Later it decided to use an own format; mainly for the build-in
presets facility. When you check this option, CsoundQt will save
the old Mac Csound widgets format in addition to the new proper
CsoundQt widget format. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Open properties when creating
widgets</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Usually you will this have ticked, to enter your
channel name and other properties when you create a widget.
<span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Widgets are an independent
window</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>CsoundQt consists of many subwindows except the main
Editor panel: the Console, the Help (Manual), the Inspector, and so
on. If you check this option, the widget panel will not be
considered as one of them, but as independent window. This means
that you cannot dock it by double-clicking on the top, like all the
other subwindows, but it may have advantages anyhow, depending on
your operating system and your configuration. <span><br/>
</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Font scaling / Font offset</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Affects the way the fonts are shown for instance in a
Label widget. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><strong>Editor</strong></p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_04_editor.png" alt="" width="500" height="517"/>  </div></div>
<p>Only one option needs some explanation:</p>
<p><span><strong>Autoplay files when launched from
file</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>If ticked, a csd file will play immediately when
opened. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<h4><span><strong>Environment</strong></span></h4>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_05_environment_1.png" alt="" width="500" height="515"/> </div></div>
<p>There are some important settings here, along with some only for
developers. We will focus on the options which can be important for
all users.</p>
<p><span><strong>Html Doc directory</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>This refers to the folder containing the Canonical
Csound Manual. If you choose View -&gt; Help Panel, and see nothing
but a message like "not found!", you will have to set here the
directory for the manual. Click on the browse button on the right
side, and choose the folder where it is on your computer.<sup data-id="dfc088d4-687a-4a23-a493-502ec5d696c6" class="endnote">5</sup> 
<span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>SADIR</strong> (Sound Analysis
Directory)</span></p>
<blockquote>You can set here the directory in which Csound will
seek for analysis files like .pvx files. <span><br/>
</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>SSDIR</strong> (Sound Sample Directory)</span></p>
<blockquote>This is very useful to set a folder for sound samples,
for instance used by <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/diskin.html">diskin</a>. You
can then refer to the sample only by name. <span><br/>
</span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>SFDIR</strong> (Sound File Directory)</span></p>
<blockquote>To specify a directory for output files. This is
usually be done in the 'Run' tab, as explained above (Output
Filename). <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>INCDIR</strong> (Include Directory)</span></p>
<blockquote>Specifies a directory for files which all called by the
<a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/include.html">#include</a>
statement. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Favorite dir</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Specifies a directory which will then appear under the
menu as 'Favorites'. <span><br/></span></blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Python script dir</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>Usually you will leave this empty so that CsoundQt
links to the Python Scripts it comes with. Only specify if you
build CsoundQt or want to change the scipts folder. <span><br/>
</span></blockquote>
<h4><span><strong>External Programs</strong></span></h4>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_06_external.png" alt="" width="500" height="522"/> </div></div>
<p>Should be self-explanatory. 'Dot' is the executable from
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org">www.graphviz.org.</a> It is used
in CsoundQt for the Code Graph Viewer (View -&gt; View Code
Graph). </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><span><strong>Template</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>This tab is useful as it allows the user to define a
default template for new CSDs. Something like this can be a great
timesaver:</span></p>
<p/><div class="group_img"><div class="image"><img src="static/10a_07_template.png" alt="" width="500" height="521"/></div></div>
