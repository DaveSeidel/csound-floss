Edits
-----

- 01-a swap red and blue colors for aliasing figures
- 01-d III explain fourth parameter for randomh and randomi.
  new figures then for 01-d-randomh and 01-d-randomi
- 03-b (variables) give more space to f-sigs (local and global)
- 04-e in Powershape section add csd example for what has been described
- 04-f perhaps start with some basic example like curtis roads
- 04-h should be revised
- add figures before and after example 05A05 (line/linseg and line/expon)
- also before 05A07
- better sound for 05B01
- 05-c 
    - perhaps add notch, shelf filter and equilizers
    - add figures
    - go deeper in the implementation of filters, perhaps with steven's udos
- 05-d add vdelay opcodes etc
- 05-e add figures showing function table contents in the last example 05F04
- 05-g a step-by-step description can be added at the end
- 05-h oeyvind's new live convolution opcode should be added here
- 05-i 
    - figure before example 05I03 to show the tremor time pointer would be nice
    - add section at the end dedicated to pvsblur, pvsmooth and similar ways
      to improve audio quality
    - add a section about pvsbin and pvstrace
    - pvshift should be added to the pitch shifting section
    - pvsosc?
- 05-k coding of the examples might be up to modernize
- 05-l should go to miscellaneous
- 07-d 
    - can we include the midi file and the sound fonts for example 07D01?
    - add hint for any script or application for midi2score
- 08-a could be more extended; perhaps take some of my chapter for the
  csound book here
- 09-b (csound in maxmsp) needs to be updated
- 10-a (csoundqt) describe some use cases here. perhaps more links to 
  csoundqt's website
- 10-f (web csound) must certainly be updated
- ask luis and hlodver to add vim and emacs mode in section 10
- 11-a certainly add short description about atsa etc
- 11-b and 11-c also more explanation
- 12-b write about ctcsound and also point to score methods.
- 12-c must be filled (philipp)
- 12-d ask nikhil about the code examples (why double slashes?)
- 14-a perhaps mark Cmask etc as historical tools


General Layout
--------------

- more space between text and examples
- footnotes should be at bottom of each chapter seperately
- relative links should work
