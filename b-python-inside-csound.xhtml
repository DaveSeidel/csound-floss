  <body><h1>B. PYTHON INSIDE CSOUND</h1><p>This chapter is based on Andrés Cabrera's article <em>Using
Python inside Csound, An introduction to the Python opcodes</em>,
Csound Journal Issue 6, Spring 2007: <a title="http://csoundjournal.com/issue6/pythonOpcodes.html" href="http://csoundjournal.com/issue6/pythonOpcodes.html">http://csoundjournal.com/issue6/pythonOpcodes.html</a>.
Some basic knowledge of Python is required. For using Csound's
Python opcodes, you must have Python installed (currently version
2.7, Python 3.x will not work). This should be the case on
OSX<sup data-id="053478c6-b984-4234-8f3e-992d1648445a" class="endnote">1</sup> 
and Linux. For Windows  some version of Python 2.7 must be
installed. If you're using 64-bit Csound, you must install a 64-bit
version of Python 2.7. Python 2.7.8 for Windows is the most recent
64-bit version of 2.7. This can be downloaded from <a title="http://csoundjournal.com/issue6/pythonOpcodes.html" href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8">https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8</a>.
When running the Windows Csound installer, you must also check the
"Python features" checkbox in the Select Components dialog.</p>

<h2>Starting the Python Interpreter and Running Python Code at
i-Time: pyinit and pyruni </h2>
<p>To use the Python opcodes inside Csound, you must first start
the Python interpreter. This is done using the <a title="http://csoundjournal.com/issue6/pythonOpcodes.html" href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/pyinit.html">pyinit</a> opcode.
The pyinit opcode must be put in the header before any other Python
opcode is used, otherwise, since the interpreter is not running,
all Python opcodes will return an error. You can run any Python
code by placing it within quotes as argument to the opcode
<a title="http://csoundjournal.com/issue6/pythonOpcodes.html" href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/pyruni.html">pyruni</a>. This
opcode executes the Python code at init time and can be put in the
heade. The example below, shows a simple csd file which prints the
text "Hello Csound world!" to the terminal.<sup data-id="52a67381-d45e-4716-bc37-a7875a3e5f5c" class="endnote">2</sup> 
Note that a dummy instrument must be declared to satisfy the Csound
parser.</p>

;run python code at init-time
pyruni "print '*********************'"
pyruni "print '*Hello Csound world!*'"
pyruni "print '*********************'"

instr 1
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 0 0
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;Example by Andrés Cabrera and Joachim Heintz
</pre>
<p>Prints:<br/>
<span>*********************<br/>
*Hello Csound world!*<br/>
********************* </span></p>
<h2>Python Variables Are Usually Global</h2>
<p>The Python interpreter maintains its state for the length of the
Csound run. This means that any variables declared will be
available on all calls to the Python interpreter. In other words,
they are global. The code below shows variables "c" and "d" being
calculated both in the header ("c") and in instrument 2 ("d"), and
that they are available in all instruments (here printed out in
instrument 1 and 3). A multi-line string can be written in Csound
with the {{...}} delimiters. This can be useful for longer Python
code snippets.</p>
<p><em><strong>EXAMPLE 12B02_python_global.csd</strong></em></p>

&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

pyinit

;Execute a python script in the header
pyruni {{
a = 2
b = 3
c = a + b
}}

instr 1 ;print the value of c
prints "Instrument %d reports:\n", p1
pyruni "print 'a + b = c = %d' % c"
endin

instr 2 ;calculate d
prints "Instrument %d calculates the value of d!\n", p1
pyruni "d = c**2"
endin

instr 3 ;print the value of d
prints "Instrument %d reports:\n", p1
pyruni "print 'c squared = d = %d' % d"
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 1 0
i 2 3 0
i 3 5 0
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;Example by Andrés Cabrera and Joachim Heintz
</pre>
<p>Prints:<br/>
<span>Instrument 1 reports:<br/>
a + b = c = 5<br/>
Instrument 2 calculates the value of d!<br/>
Instrument 3 reports:<br/>
c squared = d = 25</span></p>
<h2>Running Python Code at k-Time</h2>
<p>Python scripts can also be executed at k-rate using pyrun. When
pyrun is used, the script will be executed again on every k-pass
for the instrument, which means it will be executed kr times per
second. The example below shows a simple example of pyrun. The
number of control cycles per second is set here to 100 via the
statement kr=100. After setting the value of variable "a" in the
header to zero, instrument 1 runs for one second, thus incrementing
the value of "a" to 100 by the Python statement a = a + 1.
Instrument 2, starting after the first second, prints the value.
Instrument 1 is then called again for another two seconds, so the
value of variable "a" is 300 afterwards. Then instrument 3 is
called which performs both, incrementing (in the '+=' short form)
and printing, for the first two k-cycles.</p>
<p><em><strong>EXAMPLE 12B03_pyrun.csd</strong></em></p>

&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-ndm0
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

kr=100

;start the python interpreter
pyinit
;set variable a to zero at init-time
pyruni "a = 0"

instr 1
;increment variable a by one in each k-cycle
pyrun "a = a + 1"
endin

instr 2
;print out the state of a at this instrument's initialization
pyruni "print 'instr 2: a = %d' % a"
endin

instr 3
;perform two more increments and print out immediately
kCount timeinstk
pyrun "a += 1"
pyrun "print 'instr 3: a = %d' % a"
;;turnoff after k-cycle number two
if kCount == 2 then
turnoff
endif
endin
&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 0 1  ;Adds to a for 1 second
i 2 1 0  ;Prints a
i 1 2 2  ;Adds to a for another two seconds
i 3 4 1  ;Prints a again
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;Example by Andrés Cabrera and Joachim Heintz
</pre>
<p>Prints:<br/>
<span>instr 2: a = 100<br/>
instr 3: a = 301<br/>
instr 3: a = 302</span></p>
<h2>Running External Python Scripts: pyexec</h2>
<p>Csound allows you to run Python script files that exist outside
your csd file. This is done using pyexec. The pyexec opcode will
run the script indicated, like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>pyexec "/home/python/myscript.py"</pre>
<p>In this case, the script "myscript.py" will be executed at
k-rate. You can give full or relative path names.</p>
<p>There are other versions of the pyexec opcode, which run at
initialization only (pyexeci) and others that include an additional
trigger argument (pyexect).</p>
<h2>Passing values from Python to Csound: pyeval(i)</h2>
<p>The opcode pyeval and its relatives, allow you to pass to Csound
the value of a Python expression. As usual, the expression is given
as a string. So we expect this to work:</p>
<p><em><strong>Not Working Example!</strong></em></p>
<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-ndm0
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

pyinit
pyruni "a = 1"
pyruni "b = 2"

instr 1
ival pyevali "a + b"
prints "a + b = %d\n", ival
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 0 0
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</pre>
<p>Running this code results in an error with this message:<br/>
<span>INIT ERROR in instr 1: pyevali: expression must evaluate in a
float</span></p>
<p>What happens is that Python has delivered an integer to Csound,
which expects a floating-point number. Csound always works with
numbers which are not integers (to represent a 1, Csound actually
uses 1.0). This is equivalent mathematically, but in computer
memory these two numbers are stored in a different way. So what you
need to do is tell Python to deliver a floating-point number to
Csound. This can be done by Python's float() facility. So this code
should work:</p>
<p><em><strong>EXAMPLE 12B04_pyevali.csd</strong></em></p>
<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-ndm0
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

pyinit
pyruni "a = 1"
pyruni "b = 2"

instr 1
ival pyevali "float(a + b)"
prints "a + b = %d\n", ival
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 0 0
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;Example by Andrés Cabrera and Joachim Heintz</pre>
<p>Prints:<br/>
<span>a + b = 3</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Passing Values from Csound to Python: pyassign(i)</h2>
<p>You can pass values from Csound to Python via the pyassign
opcodes. This is a very simple example which calculates the cent
distance of the proportion 3/2:</p>
<p><em><strong>EXAMPLE 12B05_pyassigni.csd</strong></em></p>
<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-ndm0
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

pyinit

instr 1 ;assign 3/2 to the python variable "x"
pyassigni "x", 3/2
endin

instr 2 ;calculate cent distance of this proportion
pyruni {{
from math import log
cent = log(x,2)*1200
print cent
}}
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 0 0
i 2 0 0
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;example by joachim heintz
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, you can neither pass strings from Csound to
Python via pyassign, nor from Python to Csound via pyeval. So the
interchange between both worlds is actually limited to numbers.</p>
<h2>Calling Python Functions with Csound Variables</h2>
<p>Apart from reading and setting variables directly with an
opcode, you can also call Python functions from Csound and have the
function return values directly to Csound. This is the purpose of
the pycall opcodes. With these opcodes you specify the function to
call and the function arguments as arguments to the opcode. You can
have the function return values (up to 8 return values are allowed)
directly to Csound i- or k-rate variables. You must choose the
appropriate opcode depending on the number of return values from
the function, and the Csound rate (i- or k-rate) at which you want
to run the Python function. Just add a number from 1 to 8 after to
pycall, to select the number of outputs for the opcode. If you just
want to execute a function without return value simply use pycall.
For example, the function "average" defined above, can be called
directly from Csound using:</p>
<pre>kave   pycall1 "average", ka, kb</pre>
<p>The output variable kave, will calculate the average of the
variable ka and kb at k-rate.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, the Python opcodes run at k-rate, but
also have i-rate versions if an "i" is added to the opcode name.
This is also true for pycall. You can use pycall1i, pycall2i, etc.
if you want the function to be evaluated at instrument
initialization, or in the header. The following csd shows a simple
usage of the pycall opcodes:</p>
<p><em><strong>EXAMPLE 12B06_pycall.csd</strong></em></p>
<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-dnm0
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

pyinit

pyruni {{
def average(a,b):
    ave = (a + b)/2
    return ave
}} ;Define function "average"

instr 1 ;call it
iave   pycall1i "average", p4, p5
prints "a = %i\n", iave
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i 1 0 1  100  200
i 1 1 1  1000 2000
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;example by andrés cabrera and joachim heintz
</pre>
<p>This csd will print the following output:<br/>
<span>a = 150<br/>
a = 1500</span></p>
<h2>Local Instrument Scope</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want Python variables to be global, and sometimes
you may want Python variables to be local to the instrument
instance. This is possible using the local Python opcodes. These
opcodes are the same as the ones shown above, but have the prefix
pyl instead of py. There are opcodes like pylruni, pylcall1t and
pylassigni, which will behave just like their global counterparts,
but they will affect local Python variables only. It is important
to have in mind that this locality applies to instrument instances,
not instrument numbers. The next example shows both, local and
global behaviour.</p>

i 2 2 1  4000
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;Example by Andrés Cabrera and Joachim Heintz
</pre>
<p>Prints:<br/>
<span>Python variable 'value' in instr 1, instance 4 = 100<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 1, instance 4 = 200<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 1, instance 4 = 300<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 1, instance 4 = 400<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 2, instance 4 = 4000<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 2, instance 4 = 4000<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 2, instance 4 = 4000<br/>
Python variable 'value' in instr 2, instance 4 = 4000</span></p>
<p>Both instruments pass the value of the score parameter field p4
to the python variable "value". The only difference is that
instrument 1 does this local (with pylassign and pyleval) and
instrument 2 does it global (with pyassign and pyeval). Four
instances of instrument 1 are called at the same time, for the same
duration. Thanks to the local variables, each assignment to the
variable "value" stays independent from each other. This is shown
when all instances are adviced to print out "value" after 0.5
seconds.</p>
<p>When the four instances of instrument 2 are called, each new
instance overwrites the "value" of all previous instances with its
own p4. So the second instance sets "value" to 2000 for itself but
only for the first instance. The third instance sets "value" to
3000 also for instance one and two. And the fourth instance sets
"value" to 4000 for all previous instances, too, and that is shown
in the printout, again after 0.5 seconds.</p>
<h2>Triggered Versions of Python Opcodes</h2>
<p>All of the python opcodes have a "triggered" version, which will
only execute when its trigger value is different to 0. The names of
these opcodes have a "t" added at the end of them (e.g. pycallt or
pylassignt), and all have an additional parameter called ktrig for
triggering purposes. See the example in the next chapter for
usage.</p>
<h2>Simple Markov Chains Using the Python Opcodes</h2>
<p>Python opcodes can simplify the creation of complex data
structures for algorithmic composition. Below you'll find a simple
example of using the Python opcodes to generate Markov chains for a
pentatonic scale. Markov chains require in practice building
matrices, which start becoming unwieldy in Csound, especially for
more than two dimensions. In Python multi-dimensional matrices can
be handled as nested lists very easily. Another advange is that the
size of matrices (or lists) need not be known in advance, since it
is not necessary in python to declare the sizes of lists.</p>
